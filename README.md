# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

Inside that directory, you can run several commands:

npx playwright test
Runs the end-to-end tests.

npx playwright test --ui
Starts the interactive UI mode.

npx playwright test --project=chromium
Runs the tests only on Desktop Chrome.

npx playwright test example
Runs the tests in a specific file.

npx playwright test --debug
Runs the tests in debug mode.

npx playwright codegen
Auto generate tests with Codegen.

We suggest that you begin by typing:

    npx playwright test
